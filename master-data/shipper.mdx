Shippers are the customer organizations that request transportation services. Consistent shipper data is critical for
billing, credit management, and customer visibility portals.

## Customer profile

| Attribute | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `legal_name` | Yes | Entity name that appears on contracts and invoices. |
| `customer_code` | Yes | Unique identifier shared with the CRM and billing platforms. |
| `billing_address` | Yes | Primary remittance address. |
| `credit_limit` | Conditional | Required when payment terms are not prepaid. |
| `account_tier` | Yes | `strategic`, `core`, or `opportunistic`. Drives SLA selections. |
| `primary_forwarder_id` | No | Links to the [Forwarder](./forwarder) managing shipments. |

### Contacts & roles

Maintain at least one contact per role:

- **Logistics manager** – receives shipment updates and exceptions.
- **Finance owner** – receives invoices and statement of account.
- **Executive sponsor** – participates in quarterly business reviews.

## Governance

1. **Sales Operations** owns the creation of new shippers and ensures CRM alignment.
2. **Credit & Collections** approves credit limits and payment terms before activation.
3. **Customer Success** validates portal access and SLA coverage.

## Implementation notes

- Import shippers from CRM exports, mapping account hierarchies to parent/child relationships.
- Configure webhooks to notify downstream systems when account tiers or credit statuses change.
- Store customer-specific compliance documents in the linked document repository with expiration alerts.
