Ports anchor routing, customs, and scheduling information. Each port record consolidates regulatory identifiers
and operational attributes so that shipments are consistently classified.

## Core attributes

| Field | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `name` | Yes | Official facility name used in customs filings. |
| `unlocode` | Yes | Five-character UN/LOCODE value identifying the location. |
| `country` | Yes | ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 code. |
| `timezone` | Yes | Olson timezone string for accurate ETA calculations. |
| `port_type` | Yes | `seaport`, `airport`, `rail_ramp`, or `inland_terminal`. |
| `latitude` / `longitude` | Yes | Decimal degrees for geospatial planning. |
| `customs_requirements` | No | Notes describing documentation or inspection needs. |

## Hierarchy & relationships

- Associate ports with the regional owner that appears in analytics dashboards.
- Link origin and destination preferences to [Service](./service) offerings to power auto-scheduling.
- Tie port drayage to preferred [Trucker](./trucker) partners for ground moves.

## Data quality controls

1. Validate UN/LOCODEs against the latest UNECE release before approving changes.
2. Enforce timezone and country lookups via controlled vocabularies.
3. Audit port usage quarterly to retire inactive locations.

## Implementation guidance

- When migrating legacy data, map ambiguous port names to unique UN/LOCODE values to prevent duplicates.
- Use the API endpoint `POST /master-data/ports` for bulk onboarding; it accepts batches of up to 500 records.
- Surface weather or disruption alerts by subscribing port records to external intelligence feeds.
