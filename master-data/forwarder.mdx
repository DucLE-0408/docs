Forwarders (also known as NVOCCs or 3PLs) orchestrate shipments across carriers and modes. Clear, structured data allows
operations teams to tender bookings, assign cost centers, and audit performance with minimal manual entry.

## Required attributes

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `name` | Legal entity name as it appears on agreements. |
| `license_number` | Regulatory identifier such as NVOCC, FMC, or customs broker license. |
| `primary_contact` | Named representative responsible for escalations. |
| `contact_channels` | Email distribution list and phone routing for after-hours support. |
| `service_modes` | Modes supported (ocean, air, road) to guide auto-assignment. |
| `credit_status` | Values: `approved`, `probation`, `suspended`. Drives financial holds. |

## Relationship mapping

- Link forwarders to the [Shipper](./shipper) accounts they manage to provide controlled access.
- Associate forwarders with preferred [Trucker](./trucker) partners for inland pickups.
- Allow forwarders to nominate booked [Services](./service) while keeping carrier contracts private.

## Governance workflow

1. **Vendor Management** verifies licensing credentials annually.
2. **Finance** reviews credit exposure and updates `credit_status` after each quarterly assessment.
3. **Operations** confirms that the partner's SLA templates are uploaded before approving new trade lanes.

## Implementation checklist

- Load historical forwarders via CSV import to preserve vendor IDs from legacy systems.
- Configure notification rules so performance scorecards are emailed monthly.
- Enable API access for forwarders that submit bookings electronically.
