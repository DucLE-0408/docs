Vessel records capture the technical characteristics and regulatory identifiers for every ship operating on our network.
Precise vessel data powers schedule accuracy, compliance, and asset planning.

## Technical specifications

| Attribute | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `imo_number` | Unique International Maritime Organization number. Required for every vessel. |
| `vessel_name` | Registered vessel name. Record historical names in the audit log. |
| `vessel_type` | Container ship, tanker, feeder, etc. Drives compatibility with services. |
| `capacity_teu` | Total twenty-foot equivalent units the vessel can carry. |
| `reefer_slots` | Count of refrigerated container plugs. |
| `flag_state` | Country where the vessel is registered. |
| `build_year` | Year the vessel entered service. |

## Operational data points

- **Owner vs. operator:** Track the owning entity separately from the [Carrier](./carrier) operating the service.
- **Classes & certificates:** Store SOLAS, ISM, and class society certificates with expiration reminders.
- **Maintenance windows:** Publish dry dock schedules so the [Service](./service) calendar can plan substitute vessels.

## Governance

1. **Fleet Management** maintains vessel specs and ensures certificate documents are current.
2. **Network Operations** approves vessel assignments to services and validates capacity updates.
3. **Risk & Compliance** audits flag state and sanction screening every quarter.

## Integration recommendations

- Expose vessel data via the `/master-data/vessels` API with filters for capacity, operator, and effectivity.
- Notify downstream planning tools using the `vessel.updated` webhook when capacity, name, or operator changes.
- Mirror vessel attributes into analytics warehouses to support fuel efficiency and utilization reporting.
