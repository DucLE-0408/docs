Welcome to the source of truth for configuring the transportation network. The Master Data domain centralizes
partners, assets, and locations so that execution systems can reference a consistent catalog.

## What belongs in Master Data?

Master Data captures the shared business concepts that every shipment, booking, and invoice refers to. We divide the domain
into the following categories:

| Category | Entities | Why it matters |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Partners | [Carriers](./carrier), [Forwarders](./forwarder), [Truckers](./trucker), [Shippers](./shipper) | Defines who we work with and how we settle services. |
| Assets & Services | [Vessels](./vessel), [Services](./service) | Controls which physical assets and scheduled services can be planned. |
| Locations | [Ports](./port) | Anchors origins and destinations to standardized codes and governance. |

Each entity page documents required attributes, governance checkpoints, and relationships to other data sets.

## Governance operating model

1. **Stewards** own the accuracy of the data within their category and approve requested changes.
2. **Data producers** submit changes via data import templates or in-app workflows that enforce validation.
3. **Data consumers** subscribe to change notifications to keep planning and execution platforms synchronized.

For more about the responsibilities in each area, review the "Governance" section in the related entity page.

## Designing with downstream systems in mind

- **Model relationships explicitly.** For example, a service references the carrier operating it and the vessel deployed on a given voyage.
- **Capture identifiers from source systems.** Downstream integrations rely on carrier SCAC codes, vessel IMO numbers, and port UN/LOCODE values.
- **Version with effectivity dates.** Maintaining start and end dates ensures we can plan future sailings without disrupting in-flight shipments.

## Suggested implementation steps

1. Prioritize [Carrier](./carrier) and [Port](./port) data so that routings can be validated end to end.
2. Configure [Service](./service) definitions to expose schedules and sailing frequencies to planning teams.
3. Onboard [Trucker](./trucker) partners alongside [Shipper](./shipper) records to unlock inland milestones.
