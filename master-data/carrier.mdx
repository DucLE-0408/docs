Carriers represent the asset-owning organizations responsible for hauling freight. Accurate carrier records
ensure capacity forecasts, rate management, and compliance reporting align with contractual commitments.

## Data model

| Field | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `name` | Yes | Commercial name that appears on contracts and invoices. |
| `scac` | Yes (ocean & truck) | Standard Carrier Alpha Code used for EDI and customs filings. |
| `carrier_code` | Conditional | Airline two-character code for air carriers. |
| `primary_mode` | Yes | Values: `ocean`, `air`, `rail`, `truck`. |
| `headquarters_location_id` | No | Reference to the [Port](./port) or inland terminal representing the corporate HQ. |
| `account_manager` | Yes | Internal owner responsible for maintaining the carrier relationship. |

### Relationships

- **Services:** Each [Service](./service) record references a carrier to inherit billing terms and performance metrics.
- **Vessels:** Carrier-to-[Vessel](./vessel) relationships track which ships are operated vs. chartered.
- **Truckers:** When carriers subcontract inland legs, link the trucker partner to the carrier for visibility.

## Governance

1. Carrier records are stewarded by the **Procurement** team.
2. Changes to legal names or SCAC codes require a regulatory compliance review before publishing.
3. Use effectivity dates to manage mergers or rebranding without breaking historical reporting.

## Integration notes

- Publish carrier master data to the transportation management system (TMS) daily via the carrier export feed.
- Maintain a lookup table mapping external system IDs so EDI acknowledgements can be reconciled.
- Trigger alerts when duplicate SCAC codes are detected across different carrier entries.
