## Operational preferences

- Capture operating hours and weekend coverage to power appointment scheduling.
- Specify contact methods for dispatch (EDI, API, email) to automate load tendering.
- Flag bonded status for moves that require customs-controlled drayage.

## Governance & compliance

1. **Safety & Security** validates insurance certificates, safety ratings, and driver qualification files every 6 months.
2. **Logistics operations** reviews on-time performance and updates preferred status each quarter.
3. **Finance** ensures W-9 and banking details are on file before releasing payments.

## Integration best practices

- Synchronize trucker data with the yard management system to show pre-approved vendors at each facility.
- Use geofencing around key [Port](./port) and warehouse locations to measure actual dwell times.
- Integrate with [Shipper](./shipper) requirements to enforce appointment visibility.
