title: "Service Master Data"
description: "Model the scheduled services and lanes offered by each carrier."
---

Services describe the marketed lanes, sailing schedules, and capacities that carriers sell. They tie together
carriers, vessels, and ports so planners can book routings with confidence.

## Service structure

| Section | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| Header | Stores the service code, marketing name, and carrier owner. |
| Schedule | Lists port rotations with standard transit times and cut-offs. |
| Capacity | Captures TEU/FEU availability or weight limits for air services. |
| Constraints | Notes on hazardous restrictions, reefer capability, or equipment limitations. |

### Required fields

- `service_code`: Unique identifier shared across planning tools.
- `carrier_id`: Reference to the owning [Carrier](./carrier).
- `mode`: `ocean`, `air`, or `truck`.
- `port_rotation`: Ordered list of [Port](./port) IDs with day offsets.
- `effective_from` / `effective_to`: Control when the service can be booked.

## Governance checkpoints

1. **Network design** proposes new services or adjustments to port rotations.
2. **Capacity planning** validates capacity ranges and approves effectivity dates.
3. **Operations** tests EDI integration with carriers before activation.

## Integration considerations

- Publish service updates to downstream systems using the `service.updated` event payload.
- Provide analytics extracts showing utilization vs. committed capacity for finance.
- When a vessel changes, update the associated [Vessel](./vessel) record and republish schedules.
