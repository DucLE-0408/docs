# Master Data Documentation

This repository hosts the documentation for the transportation Master Data platform. The guides explain how partners,
assets, and locations are modeled and governed so that execution systems share a consistent source of truth.

- **`master-data/`** – Entity-specific guides covering carriers, forwarders, truckers, ports, services, shippers, and vessels.
- **`archive/`** – Contains the Mintlify starter-kit content retained for reference.
